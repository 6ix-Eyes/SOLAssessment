## SOLIDITY

This is a basic program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a simulation and guide on how coding in Solidity works.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two functions that increments and decrements the value of total supply. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
